## About me
Hi, there 👋. My name is **Sang**. I am a developer with 3+ years experience specializing in the web development. Super nerd who loves Vim, Linux and enjoys to customize all of the development environment. Interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if the need arises.
